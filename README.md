This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in TypeScript related to type coercion.  While TypeScript's type system helps prevent many errors at compile time, it doesn't guarantee the absence of runtime errors in all cases. The `add` function is intended to work only with numbers, but type coercion allows a string to be passed without a compile-time error. This results in a runtime error, a situation that is difficult to identify and debug.
